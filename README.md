This is my first full stack MERN website. 
Learnt alot from authentication, setting up the database, connecting the backend to the frontend.
Learn CRUD in mongoDB whilst making this

To set up locally:
## Backend
### 1. Change directory to api folder
`cd api`
### 2. Start api
`nodemon index.js`
## Frontend
### 1. Change directory to client folder
`cd client`
### 2. Start the React App
`yarn start`

### Note -- You will have to connect to your own MongoDB or a local mongoDB server as the database in the code has been deleted by me
